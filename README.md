# Detective Game

Welcome to the Detective Game, a text-based murder mystery game written in Python. In this game, you play the role of a detective trying to solve a murder mystery by questioning suspects, inspecting the crime scene, and making accusations.

## How to Play

1. **Introduction**: 
    - You are a detective tasked with solving a murder mystery.
    - The victim's identity and the murder weapon are randomly generated at the beginning of the game.
    - You have a list of suspects; one of them is the murderer, but you don't know who.
    - Your goal is to identify the murderer and the murder weapon.

2. **Game Loop**:
    - The game operates in a loop where you can choose from the following options:
        - **Question a Suspect**: You can question a randomly chosen suspect. The suspect may act nervously or have an alibi.
        - **Inspect the Crime Scene**: You can inspect the crime scene and discover clues, such as the murder weapon and other evidence.
        - **Make an Accusation**: When you think you've gathered enough evidence, you can make an accusation by specifying a suspect and a murder weapon.
        - **Quit**: You can quit the game at any time.

3. **Winning the Game**:
    - To win the game, you must make a correct accusation by naming both the murderer and the murder weapon.
    - If your accusation is correct, you've solved the case and captured the murderer.
    - If your accusation is incorrect, the murderer remains at large.
